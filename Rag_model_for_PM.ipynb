            " thanks for asking! The issue seems to be related to the ASML plan, which is a Business Enterprise plan that is currently only showing Starter level plan analytics. The plan's authorizations are not being updated correctly, resulting in the removal of hundreds of users, although many have been added back. The plan's license type was switched from Professional to another type on January 8th. The support staff needs prompt assistance to resolve this issue. \n",
